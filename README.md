A modern web application for transcribing speech from audio files or live voice recordings using OpenAI's Whisper large-v3 model (via Hugging Face Transformers). Features a beautiful dark purple UI, drag-and-drop upload, browser-based recording, and Sinhala speech recognition support.

## Features
- üé§ Record voice directly in your browser (with waveform visualization)
- üìÅ Upload audio files (WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WebM)
- üìù Instant speech-to-text transcription using Whisper large-v3 (multilingual, including Sinhala)
- üìã Copy transcription to clipboard
- üéß Playback your audio
- Responsive, modern dark purple design

## Sinhala Support

This app now supports Sinhala (‡∑É‡∑í‡∂Ç‡∑Ñ‡∂Ω) speech recognition using OpenAI's Whisper large-v3 model. Just upload or record Sinhala audio and receive Sinhala text transcription. Whisper also supports many other languages‚Äîsee [Whisper documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for details.

**Note:** Whisper large-v3 is a very large model. For best performance, use a machine with a modern GPU. CPU inference is possible but much slower.

## Model

This app uses the [openai/whisper-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3) model from Hugging Face for multilingual (including Sinhala) speech recognition.

## Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-to-text-app.git
cd speech-to-text-app
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install ffmpeg (required for .webm audio)
- Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
- Add the `bin` folder to your system PATH
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -version
  ```

### 4. Run the app
```bash
python app.py
```
